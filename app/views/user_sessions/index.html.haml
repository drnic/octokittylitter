    This is not the real GitHub. It's a sample sandbox.

        Say you wanted to build a third party GitHub service that interacted
        with either the Github APIs or the website itself, then you'd just
        love to have a Sandbox - a fake Github site that behaved like Github
        but you controlled the internal data.

        = link_to "Octo Kitty Litter", "http://github.com/drnic/octokittylitter"
        is that Sandbox.
      %p
        Why "Octo Kitty Litter"? It's the Sandbox for Github's Octocat.

        Currently, only two features of GitHub have been implemented: registration/login, and the
        inbox/mail system.
